* Visualize the Git history

  This is quite inspired by [[https://adamtornhill.com/][Adam Tornhill's]] "Your code as a crime scene", "Software design XRays" 

  The main difference is that i am trying to implement some of the algorithms.

  

* Project goals

  - Have fun coding stuff!
  - Learn about Software Architecture git, python,js, d3.js et al
  - Use python to create json from git output that can be fed with minimal js to d3.js
  - Have some level of interactivity
  - Focus on C++ projects
